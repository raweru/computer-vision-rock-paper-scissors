# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

First thing starting this project was to setup and clone the Github repo, which was an easy task, as we done the same already in the previous project "Hangman".

## Milestone 2: Create the computer vision system

Creating the computer vision system was a a breeze using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), which provides a simple way to record your data and train a deep learning model. Using our webcam, we recorded around 500 photos for each class (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing), that were used to train the computer vision model.

After training was finished, we downloaded the model as "keras_model.h5" and "labels.txt" into the local repository and commit and push the changes to Github.
